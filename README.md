"Marvel: Ultimate War" is a 2-player battle game where each player selects 3 champions to form their team and fight against the other player's team. The battle takes place on a 5x5 grid. Players take turns attacking each other's champions using normal attacks or special abilities. Each champion has attributes such as health points, mana, normal attack damage, normal attack range, speed, and condition (active, inactive, or knocked out). Champions can perform actions such as moving, normal attacking, casting abilities, and using leader abilities. Abilities are categorized as damaging, healing, or effect abilities, with different targets and ranges. At the start of the battle, each player designates one champion as their leader, who gains a special ability that can be used once per battle. The gameplay flows with champions taking turns based on their speed, and the game ends when a player defeats all three of the opponent's champions.
